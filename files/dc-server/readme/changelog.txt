Data Crow version 4.2.2 - Maintenance                              Released on 2017-08-23
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- File Importer did not always find a correct match when using an online service.
  The match checker has been improved. 

[Changed]
- Updated most of the libraries to the latest version.
- Updated the database engine (HSQLDB) to version 2.4 (from 2.3.4)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.2.1 - From ruin to riches                      Released on 2017-06-27
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Normal users could not log into Data Crow when starting the Data Crow server client.
- The installer did not run "As Administrator" in Windows, causing the Program Files
  folder to not be accessible to the installer. Made an investment in a new executable
  builder which does support running in elevated mode (automatically).
- Imdb.com search was broken. This was mainly caused by the free API turning private.
  I have opted in for the amount of 10 USD a month to keep this service alive 
  (http://www.omdbapi.com).

[Changed]
- Polish translation has been updated. The translation was done by Ariel Chylek, many
  thanks! 
- OFDB.de has been removed. It was in shambles and was not based on an actual API, 
  something which is a bit of a "no no" in terms of both stability and reliability.
- Removed TheGamesDB, their API is still down unfortunately. I have switched 
  this service off for now, hoping to be able to enable it again when it's back.
 
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.2.0 - Revitalizing patch                       Released on 2017-02-18
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Navigation to external references is no longer allowed.
- The server operated in local mode for displaying images. To avoid this, and to keep
  things simple, you now have to supply the IP address used on startup of the server
  (-ip:<IP address>). This allows you to specify whether to use the public IP address
  (or not).
- Newly created users were not able to log on. This was only the case if no changes
  were made to the permissions of the user. Newly created users can now always log on,
  regardless of changes made.
- When -dir: parameter was given to Data Crow and the path contained a space, the 
  installation folder is incorrectly determined.
- Network client did not correctly check for empty required fields. 
  The server would fail to save the item, but would fail to notify the client of this
  fact. On restart, the item (not saved) has disappeared from the view.
- Web UI: same item details shown for different items when navigating between pages
  in the paginator.
- Web UI: cannot log on with newly created non-administrator user.
- Web UI: not returned to login page when directly navigating to index.xhtml. No
  data is loaded which is good, but an HTML error is displayed.
- Imdb.com searches: missing images in search results.
- Imdb.com searches: year parsing errors, for some records.
- Moviemeter.nl: was broken completed, reactivated.
- Amazon.com: access key has been changed for security reasons. After applying additional
  security to the Amazon.com account, the service for previous versions of Data Crow
  became unavailable. With this patch, the service has been restored.
- Amazon search has not been throttled to 1 item every second to avoid flooding
  the service with request. 
- Tab order for the item form was not loaded correctly, causing the setting to be lost
  after restarting Data Crow.
- The Quick Search did not work when including %, - or ' in the search string.
- File URLs in the quick view will now work correctly.

[Removed]
- Metacritic.com online search. The search plugin was too error prone and can no 
  longer be maintained. This service has been removed.
- MobyGames online search has been disabled. Awaiting new implementation based on their
  API as currently provided.

[Changed]
- Web UI has been improved. The item overview has been changed to a card like 
  overview and the item form has also been improved. Many other small improvements have
  been made for you to check out.
- The online search has been set to only retrieve up to a maximum of 20 items 
  at a time.
- Increased the input size for the Drive Mappings field from 10 to 50.
  
 [New]
 - Polish translation has been added. 
 
 [Known issues]
 - The GamesDB service is currently offline due to server issues. Service operation 
   will be restored soon, after which this online service should be working again.
   (reference: https://www.facebook.com/thegamesdb).
 - Amazon service can still be flooded with requests when Data Crow is used by 
   many users at the same time. This service should be re-implemented to use batching
   of item lookups. Awaiting to see if the throttling actually helps first.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.1.1 - Revival patch                            Released on 2016-06-16
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After a long period of silence, Data Crow rises again to the surface. This patch updates
the external libraries and fixes the most urgent problems. Luckily 4.1 has proven to be 
very stable indeed. It's time to continue onwards to version 4.2.

[Fixed]
- Upgrade process; saving icons to disk was only triggered when upgrading from version 
  4.0.16 or older. This step will be redone with this version.
- Password could not be changed after setting it for a user.
- For both the server and the client, a different database (as supplied with -db:) could 
  not be used.
- For reports the images are now scaled to allow for a maximum dimension of 200x200.
  This to reduce the size of the images and subsequently the report as generated.
- Quick search doesn't work when a quote is in the search value.
- Editing a item "as new" disallows deleting images.
- Play length (duration) incorrectly displayed in the table view.
- The Metacritics.com online search engine did no longer retrieve the title.
  
[Changed]
- The French translation has been improved. All thanks to eReFBe!
- The Softpedia search engine and the Sourceforge.net search engine have been removed. 
  Unfortunately the implementation no longer holds. Each site update is potentially 
  disruptive to these service since there's no web service to get the information 
  reliably and in a structured manner.

[Library Updates]
- PrimeFaces: 5.2 => 6.0
- HSQLDB: 2.3.2 => 2.3.4
- JasperSoft Reports: 5.6.0 => 6.2.2
- JTattoo: 1.6.10 => 1.6.11


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.1 - Crossroads edition                         Released on 2015-07-04
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[New]
- This version contains the new web server as part of the existing server architecture. 
  This replaces the old web module as was delivered with version 3 but never made it into 
  version 4. The web server delivers the following functionality:
  ~ Searching for items (Search..)
  ~ Creating new item (File > Create New)
  ~ Edit item (Right-Click > Edit)
  ~ Navigation between items (for example, open a software title, then click on it's 
    category, then see which other items have been assigned to this category, etc.). 
  ~ Picking fields for the overview and the item form (web). (Settings > ..)
  ~ Full security model has been implemented
  This web server delivers the same basic functionality (with a tad more style) as the
  old web module and will be expanded upon with each and every normal (4.x) delivery 
  (see the roadmap at http://datacrow.net). 
  Note: this web server is a module of the existing (since 4.0) server edition.
  It allows the server to serve both full (thick) clients as well as web clients at the
  same time. The web server uses an embedded version of Tomcat, version 8.0.23.

[Fixed]
- Change password on a network client caused errors / did not work.
- NullPointerException during start up for users with very limited rights logging onto
  the server.

[Changed]
- MP4 support for Movie File import. Many thanks Lars Kövari!
- The Data Crow Server manual has been updated to reflect the 4.1 changes.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.0.16                                           Released on 2015-05-28
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A few feathers were disheveled in the past few months, time to straighten things up!

[New]
- TheGamesDB.net online service has been implemented.
- Credentials for the server can now be supplied through the datacrow.credentials file.
  The Server Manual has been updated to explain this further.

[Fixed]
- Fixed MobyGames.com; Picture import was not working.
- MovieMeter.nl was not updated to use the new API. Re-implemented this service.
- New Item Wizard was closed after notifying an empty field was left empty (loss of data)
- Update All Problems; error when renumbering.
- Update All Problems; check box field value was always applied. Will now only be applied
  if checked / value has been set.
- Update All Problems; with auto numbering enabled, the same value was applied to all.
  Auto numbering fields have been removed from the update all dialog.
- The -userdir: parameter was not checked on it's format; \ or / is now appended 
  if missing.
- Right-click menu for child records (such as Sort, Launch File and Update All) 
  was incorrectly executing the commands against the main record.
- Maintain tabs; on removal of a tab the tabs was still being diplayed in the list.
- Checkboxes, with their initial value, always caused the item to be marked as changed.
- Stop button was not enabled when the Mass Update task was started.

[Changed]
- Updated the Brazilian translation; thanks ever so much Gustavo Rezende!
- Corrected the Portuguese translation; thanks ever so much Pedro!
- The custom label field in the General Field Settings is now represented as an
  editable text field to avoid confusion.
- The Multiplayer? field of the game module has been replaced by two checkbox field
  "Multiplayer Game" and "Cooperative Multiplayer". This removes the Yes/No field.
  For existing installations the field is disabled (not removed).

Data Crow version 4.0.15                                           Released on 2015-01-22
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Changed]
- Boosted traffic between client<>server. Implemented JSON-IO to limit data send.
- Data Crow Server can now initialize the data folder.
- Server communication has been encrypted (simple encryption, nothing fancy).
- Server communication is now compressed.

[Fixed]
- Older installation can have duplicated module files starting with .#. These will
  now be ignored when starting Data Crow.
- Find & Replace had an error when trying to apply the replacements.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.0.14                                           Released on 2015-01-13
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Changed]
- Data Crow server performance has been improved. Performance is still not optimal but
  has been increased but approximately 25%. Images are now served by Jetty, which will 
  also be used for hosting the web application (version 4.1). Additionally the connection
  between client and server is reused (as it should be) instead of established on each
  request.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.0.13                                           Released on 2015-01-05
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Issue with online search; images not saved.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.0.12                                           Released on 2015-01-03
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- User fields not visible on the form.
- Conversion from single reference to multi-reference could fail in case of invalid
  entries in the database.

[New]
- Portuguese help files, major thanks to Pedro (pmraps)!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.0.11                                           Released on 2015-01-01
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Security fix; regardless of the field security settings fields were still shown to 
  users.
- Fixed an issue with non US-ASCII filenames; backup process failed.
- Issue with custom reference fields linked to the music album module. These always 
  showed up as a "Record Label" module.
- Item importer; child items on update of existing items failed. Trying to update an 
  existing music album would not update the music tracks.
- Parent key cannot be NULL exception when trying to save a music album after updating
  it with an online service.
  
[Changed]
- Discogs.com has been removed due to the restrictive authentication flow.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.0.10                                           Released on 2014-09-02
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Fixed an upgrade issues for the Audio CD and Music Album merge. The error occurred in
  case online services were never used and the columns SERVICE and SERVICEURL were 
  therefore missing. 
- Fixed an upgrade issue for the Audio CD and and Music Album merge. The error occurred
  in case the new tables already exists due to a faulty earlier upgrade or because the
  user installed version 4.0 on top of version 3.12.5. Now, Data Crow will delete
  empty tables required for the new Music Album module. If they contain records, the
  upgrade will fail.
- The module wizard did not handle special characters correctly.
- Tabs containing special characters were not stored and retrieved correctly.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.0.9                                            Released on 2014-08-27
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Problem resolved for report creation; report not created. Was reported fixed in 
  version 4.0.8 but was still failing for some. The functionality has been tested and 
  has been confirmed to solve the issue.
- After a module has been created and a field has been marked as descriptive the
  view still shows empty labels. 
  
[Changed]
- The upgrade will now silently copy missing reports and translations to the user folder.
  Existing files will no longer be overwritten.
- Added additional report types; Word Document (DOCX), Excel Document (XLSX), 
  Excel Document 97-2003 (XLS).
- Added titles to the various message and question boxes.
- Added nicer descriptions for the report types.
- Added various tool tips for the define field dialog (create module wizard).
  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.0.8                                            Released on 2014-08-25
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- GUID (internal ID) shown for Contact Person in the loan history of the Loan Information
  panel.
- Problem resolved for report creation. This was an old issue which was hard to simulate. 
  An additional check has been added to check whether the file is accessible.
- Not all fields can be added to the Item Report.
- _Persist fields could be selected for the Quick View. 
- Server didn't have the library jacksum added to the class path which caused failures 
  for file hashing.

[Changed]
- The item exported now ignores system fields. Additionally the importer now only tries
  to match an item on import by ID in case the match and merge option has been checked.
- The Create Report manual has been updated.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.0.7                                            Released on 2014-08-20
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[New]
- The old reporting engine has been removed. This version now features full support for 
  Jasper Reports (http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jaspersoft-studio). 
  The main benefits of this switch is that it is no longer required to created 
  separate reports (XLST scripting files) for PDF and HTML reports. The reports
  of JasperReports can be saved as PDF, RTF and HTML. Additionally you can use the free
  Jaspersoft Studio Software to create reports, graphically. This brings a lot more
  power to the reporting capabilities of Data Crow. Data Crow generates the reports 
  on the exported XML files.

[Changed]
- Apache Fop and Avalon Framework (discontinued) have been dropped from this release.
- Icons for message and question boxes have been changed, making use of Java 7 features.

[Fixed]
- Error on startup when the images were supposed to be migrated to the new location.
- NullPointerException when importing files which already are registered in the system.
- Fixed an issue with saving child items.
- Removed defective library which caused image import errors.
- Item Importer bug has been fixed which could caused field values not to be imported
  correctly.
- Still numbering inconsistencies for music tracks.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.0.6                                            Released on 2014-08-17
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- A NullPointerException for the item import has been fixed.
- Potential NullPointerException in case a query fails.
- Logging panel was registered too late in the startup process; missing messages.
- A bug has been fixed where the module importer consumed too much memory. 
  This occurred for larger module exports holding an x number of large images.
  As an added benefit it works now much faster.
- Server startup error; modules could not be loaded.
- Record label list is now sorted by name.
- Fixed an issue where the quick filter bar is shown underneath the toolbar.
  The quick filter is now placed directly on the toolbar itself. The setting
  [toggle quick filter] has now been removed.
- The Drive Manager functionality was broken.
- Resource Editor save issues.
- File Tree panel inconsistencies have been resolved.
- New Item Wizard - pictures not saved for newly saved items.
- Create Multiple Items lacked the option to save.

[Changed]
- The help (F1) has been updated to explain the Quick Search functionality.
- The German translation has been updated; thanks to Ralf Geiss!
- On startup after any upgrade you'll be asked whether you want to use the new 
  translation files.
- File tree panel now shows folder icon for folders which are present on the file system.
- Splash screen was shown quite late in the startup process.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.0.5                                            Released on 2014-08-15
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Data Crow hangs in case there are unsaved changes in the table view on exiting.
- In rare cases the grouping pane showed zero items while x number of items are present.
- CSV and XML import issues have been fixed.
- Module naming inconsistencies which caused the alter module wizard to fail for 
  various modules, such as the book and container module.
- Items with ID's created before 2006 were not shown anymore in the tree views when
  clicking on a node.
- Behind the scenes, the view was loaded twice on the initial startup.
- Retrieve Audio CD now adds the retrieved CD information to the overview.
- Required field check failure; items were not check upon required fields.

[Changed]
- Record label module; name is now required and checked for uniqueness. Note that
  custom Record Label settings will be reset to accommodate for this minor change.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.0.4                                            Released on 2014-08-12
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Changed]
- Improved Error Handling for recovery. When the database load fails due to 
  inconsistencies Data Crow would in the past just show the user login page. Now, 
  Data Crow will rename the database, show the correct error and close Data Crow.
  On a next start Data Crow is started with a clean new database. The user can now
  restore the last backup. The faulty database does still exists and can be send by email
  to analyze and fix if possible.
- Improved the handling of user folders; 
  You can now switch between user folders without copying the data over from the existing
  folder. The option to copy the data has been made an option from the user folder 
  selection dialog.
- Improved handling of old databases; it was always the idea for users to perform an 
  restore of existing backup in the latest version. Most users however upgrade directly
  which is actually almost enforced by Data Crow. Data Crow will now warn the user in
  case the old database requires a different upgrade path, such as first upgrading to 
  version 3.12.5. Data Crow will not allow the user to continue to avoid database 
  corruption.
- Quick filter is now a search all field; it will search for text and numbers in all
  applicable and search enabled fields at once. On the quick filter bar I have now also 
  placed an icon to quickly open the advanced filter dialog. With this change the 
  quick filter bar is simpler to use whereas the advanced filter dialog can be used to
  create filters of a high complexity (and remember, these can be saved for re-use).
  Note; it is not possible to use regex expressions in the quick filter (not supported
  by the underlying HSQL database). 
- Added Find & Replace to the Filter menu.
- Upgraded HSQLDB (http://hsqldb.org/) to the latest version (2.3.2).
- Added a "Create Support Package" menu item to the help menu. Creates a zip file
  containing all files needed for identifying and resolving problems.

[Fixed]
- Find and Replace was not working correctly.
- Open Item from the right-click menu did not work.
- Fixed an issue in the Database Editor; first column was not shown in the query results.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.0.3                                            Released on 2014-08-06
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A small but important bug fix was required. The bug causes a startup error, introduced by
the 4.0.2 version released yesterday. Fixed 2 additional upgrade issues which occurred 
for some users.

[Fixed]
- Error message; full control needed for the install directory. This message was 
  intended for the server installation only. The client doesn't need this anymore with 
  this version.
- Upgrade error in case the old images folder contains sub-directories.
- Fixed an error for the Audio CD and the Music Album merge.
 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.0.2                                            Released on 2014-08-05
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT: as of version 4.0.2 Java 7 or higher is required. 

[Fixed]
- Performance issue for network clients has been fixed.
- No message box in case of a warning when deleting or saving an item (only message
  in the log file).
- New Item Wizard did not close after saving and view was not updated.
- Right-click in view, create report, added all items instead of the selected items.
- Error when creating report, invalid path for fonts, report was created though.
  An empty fonts folder will now be created by the installer.
- CSV import was no longer available.
- NullPointerException after entering wrong username / password.
- A faulty library has been removed. The library caused issues with the tree panels 
  such as incorrect item counts or even preventing loading the items at all.
- Server could not run headless.
- Create multiple for music tracks did not show the track number field.
- Create multiple for music tracks; NullPointerException when adding tracks.
- Custom modules were not loaded.
- Patch applied for #625, thanks (StringUtils.normalize2; invalid characters)

[Changed]
- Server no longer requires the file importers, synchronizers and online services to 
  be present (architectural change).
- TrueZip upgraded to the latest version (from 7.7.1 to 7.7.6).
- Image sizes have been increased as well as the quality of the thumbnails. Storage
  size will increase by approximately 20% due to this change.
- The wwwroot folder will be removed from the user folder. You might be asked to remove 
  it manually in case it was not fully successful.
- Additional error handling for faulty modules.
- Changed the font size and color for the help files for better reading.
- Upgrade of the metadata-extractor library to the latest version.

Data Crow version 4.0.1                                            Released on 2014-07-25
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This version can be safely installed on top the 4.0 version. Do not install this version
in the same directory as an older version (3.12.5 and eralier); install this version 
into another directory.

[Fixed]
- Better error handling in case of duplication in the mapping tables for the upgrade.
- Performance bug in the quick view has been fixed.
- Query Panel did not show error messages
- Properties overview did not refresh after deleting an item.
- User mode was not applied, only after a restart.
- Errors due to existing module upgrade files. I have implemented fail safes to make sure
  these are skipped and Data Crow is started.
  
[Changed]
- On upgrading the Audio CD's are merged into the Music Album module. I have now assigned
  storage medium 'Audio CD' to these merged Audio CD's.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 4.0                                              Released on 2014-07-23
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a new major release. DO NOT install this version in the same location as
the old version as this will cause the program to fail to start. 

NOTE 1 I have found that in old installations it is possible that both books.jar and a
       book.jar file exists within the modules folder. Remove the books.jar file as the
       book.jar file is the actual file used for saving module wizard changes.
       
NOTE 2 All modifications made to the Music Album and the Audio CD modules will be 
       undone by the upgrade. There was no other way to get the Music Album and 
       Audio CD modules merged.
       
NOTE 3 The web version is scheduled for version 4.1 and is not part of the 4.0 version.

[New]
- Client-Server mode. Full stand alone application server is now available. See Client-
  Server notes for more details. This has been achieved through a complete change of the 
  Data Crow architecture.

[Changed]
! The Audio CD module and the Music Album module have been merged together. It did no 
  longer make sense to have them as separate modules. There is no loss of functionality.
- Italian translation has been updated. Big thanks to Marco Artioli!
- Added additional file support to the movie file import.
- Changed the tabs saving mechanism. Tabs are also no longer stored in the database but
  our now saved per client. This makes it possible for users to create their own form 
  design.
- Code re-structuring; making the code and architecture future proof. This was a huge
  undertaking but will not be directly visible to you as a user apart from having 
  new features released in the (near) future which would not have been possible otherwise.
- Upgraded Apache Tika to version 1.5
- Added a column selector to table views (right-click on the table header).
- The discogs.com music search has been implemented using the official API, making it more 
  reliable and future proof. 
- Added Record Label to the the Music Album Module.
- The Sourceforge.net online service has been rewritten to use the official API, making it 
  more reliable and future proof. 
- JTattoo (Look and Feel manager) has been upgraded to version 1.6.10.
- You can now place true type fonts (TTF files) in the fonts directory of the install
  folder. These will be loaded by Data Crow and can then be used. They will appear at 
  the bottom of any of the font selection lists.
- PDF reports now can make use of Fonts installed (copied) to the fonts folder of the
  Data Crow installation folder.
- Additional settings can be done by the user by editing the "pdf_config.xml" file
  as located in the reports folder (of the user directory). Instructions:

  pattern will now always be applied first.
- Lent versus lend grammar mistakes.
- Avoiding null pointer exceptions in case fields no longer exists.
- Restart of the Delete Module Wizard started the Create Module Wizard
- Problems with the creation of modules due to invalid table names caused by special
  characters. Now the names are auto generated.

- Mismatch between the contact person module name and the module jar file.
- A white space for decimal grouping symbol is reset to "." after a restart.
- Drive Manager window settings not applied correctly.

[Client-Server Notes]
A manual has been released: http://www.datacrow.net/#downloads

Highlights:
* Clients don't have access to restore and backup functionality, regardless of their
  access rights. These options are solely available when running Data Crow directly on
  the server. Future versions might have scheduled backup routines.
* Server can be started using the server command. It's a headless server, meaning it 
  doesn't require a monitor / has not GUI.
* Clients are thick clients. Wait for the new web GUI release for thin client access.
  Note that Data Crow will always support the client-server mode as currently released.
  The code has been optimized for client-server access. Data is pulled in small batches.
  For example, when scrolling in the table and list view only does items
  are fully retrieved from the server which are currently visible. Clients connected to
  a server will however always be slower than standalone clients.
* User management is available directly and has remained unchanged from previous
  version. You can indicate on field level if the user has access to it and what he/she
  can do with the field content (read/update/delete).
* Icons are cached on each client. No synchronization on icon changes has yet been 
  implemented. Nothing else is cached on the clients. After a restart of a client
  the icons are retrieved from the server.
* The clients retrieve the settings, modules and value enhancers from the server.
  Not all settings can be done on the client due to security restraints.
* Modules, system settings and value enhancers are downloaded from the server on startup,
  this way the server is in control for the modules and system wide settings.

Data Crow version 3.12.5                                           Released on 2013-10-09
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Too many versions!!!" - "You do not have to upgrade" ;-)

[Fixed]
- Ratings again shown as boxes in the quick view. Fixed - for now and ever.
- File Importer issues fixed where items were not added to the view (but became visible
  after a restart). Rare occurrence.
- Module settings for Software table view caused columns to show multiple times. Default
  setting has been fixed.
- Deletion no longer allowed from Media module. Enabling this would cause deletion in
  general to go a lot slower.
- Category was no longer processed correctly for the Softpedia online search.

[Changed]
- After an import the view will now always refresh instead of adding the items one by 
  one immediately after they have been processed. This improves speed and just works a
  better.
- Removed setting "Add directly" from file import; Data Crow will now always add items
  directly.
  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 3.12.4                                           Released on 2013-10-06

[Changed]
- Rating star images have been changed.
- Added ISBN 10 and ISBN 13 fields to the quick filter.
- The Mobygames.com online search has been rewritten completely.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 3.12.3                                           Released on 2013-09-07
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Alter module wizard: change field; maximum length always defaulted to 255.
- Potential issue for Template Name and Default field. These could conflict with the
  normal fields of the module.
- Exported field order is now the same each time.
- Item matching on import is now also done on the "key fields".
  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 3.12.2                                           Released on 2013-08-15
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Changed]

- Template default and name have been moved to the "Template Properties" tab.

[Fixed]
- Changes not saved using the quick filter on resource editor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 3.12.1                                           Released on 2013-08-04
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A minor release to include additional changes and new functionality. Much needed fixes
for the references fields have finally been included. 

[Fixed]
- Icons for containers not shown in trees, fields and in the quick view.
- Icon for modules disappears in the Media module.
- Error loading setting if value is erroneously empty.

[Changed]
- Merging property items will now also update the "alternative names" field, merging
  items returned from online searches, etc., automatically.
- In the past, due to performance issues, I had refrained from updating trees in case
  a property was changed. This has now been fully implemented; changing an icon will
  immediately be reflected on trees, multi-reference views and the quick view panel.
- Added quick filter to the related items and fixed the sorting.
- Added quick filter for the items tab of containers. Sorting cannot be fixed just yet.
- Several minor layout changes (button alignment) such as for the tool select wizard and
  the update all dialog.
  
[New]
- Added a right-click option for the related items tab of the item form to 
  remove the selected items as a reference.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 3.12                                             Released on 2013-08-03
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Poor version 3.11. It only took a couple of days and then it got replaced by version 3.12.
This really is for the most part a cosmetic edition. I have changed the layout a bit 
further. This is also a preparation for the web GUI since I want to keep the layout for
both the same, for as far as possible. Due to the list of changes made and the addition 
of new functionality I have decided to release this as a normal version instead of a minor 
version.

[New]
- The property items overview (found in the Administration menu) gained a new tool: 
  delete unassigned items. This will remove all properties not assigned to any other item
  For example a category not used in software items will be removed.
- Another new tool for the properties module is the merge functionality.
  Having many categories (for example) which actually have the same meaning? Merge them
  all into one property. All references to the properties will be corrected 
  (without duplication, of course).
- The Resource Editor now has find and replace functionality.

[Changed]
- The screen is now much cleaner and it makes the application look simpler.
- The file associations setting now also allows parameters to be defined.
- New items tab has been removed. 
- Online Search will now directly save the item instead of adding the item to the 
  "new" tab.
- Chart tab has been removed. You can open the new charts dialog from the tools menu
  as well as from the tool bar.
- Create Multiple Items tool has been added (as a replacement for the new items tab).
- Item importer will open the new items dialog to lists the imported items before saving
  them.
- The module bar has been changed. Labels have been removed. Additionally the select 
  module section has been improved. Selecting a sub module will highlight it on the 
  main module panel.
- Improved startup time by building forms on demand instead of on startup (where
  possible) - 4.9 seconds on an almost empty database in 3.12 against 6.0 seconds on
  the same database with version 3.11.1.
- ISBNdb.com has been changed and the information is of limited use now to Data Crow.
  This service has been disabled.
- Help has been updated to reflect all of the above (press F1 once in a while just for
  the sake of using it).
- The Find and Replace utility now also allows you to change one reference with another.
- Update all now refreshed the overview after updating the items (instead of updating 
  one by one). 

[Fixed]
- On startup Data Crow tried to modify files in the installation folder, causing problems
  for Windows platforms. Data Crow can now be launched without administrator permissions.
- Applying settings such as the language change was only properly applied after a restart.
- Sort order of persons has been fixed (always sorts on complete name now, takes care of
  rewritten names).
- Screen parts resized ever so slightly and ever so annoyingly.
- Could not really tell which module was selected.
- Fix for launching files from the Quick View Panel.
- Column order for tables not correctly applied.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow version 3.11.1                                           Released on 2013-07-20
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Logger not initialized error message on prompt / console.
- File launcher fixes (for all platforms).
- Indicated "run as administrator" for the data crow executable and the setup executables
- Column names in the database are no longer allowed to start with a digit. The
  module wizards have been updated accordingly.
- Still a Log4j not initialized message at the command prompt, argh.., fixed forever!
- Imdb.com not working.

[Changed]
- Paths for files linked to items are now handled a bit differently;
  a) if the file is located in the Data Crow installation directory a relative filename
     is used.
  b) if you are using drive mappings across Windows / Linux the backslashes and slashes
     will be corrected as well.
  The original filename is stored unmodified(!)
- the user folder selector now checks for:
  a) existing folder selected, containing files (continue y/n).
  b) moving from one location to another (move files y/n).
  c) root folder not allowed as a Data Crow user folder.
- Readme.txt added for the installer (which setup executable to use..)
- Readme.txt of Data Crow updated.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.11  [Released on July 22 2013]  [testing: moderate]  [target: production]

[New]
- iCalendar export for the loan administration (Tools > iCalendar Loan Export)
- New online search (TheMovieDB.org). This online search supports searching for movie
  information in multiple languages.

  tags to items. Tags are the same across all modules. Auto-completion while typing 
  is supported to re-use existing tags. 

[Fixed]
- Various potential resource leaks have been discovered and fixed.
- Potential errors in video parser have been fixed.
- Changed the backup process to ignore any "non-DataCrow" files.

- Setup executable files now available for both the 32bit and the 64bit Java version.
- Issue with the CD reader "Executable name has embedded quote, split the arguments java" 
  has been fixed.

[Changed]
- Added parameter "port:" to specify the port to be used by the web server on start up.
- In case the user folder is cleaned Data Crow will re-initialize the folder.
- Added the option to change the user folder on startup. You can hide this question on 
  next runs. The option is always available from the settings menu.
- For new users only - font size increased from 11 to 12. Note that you can change the
  font and its size yourself from within Settings > Settings > Font.
- Newly supported file types for the file importer are now configured automatically.
- jAudioTagger library update from 2.0 to 2.2.
- Filter error when filtering on the due date from / to in the loan administration.
- Various small improvements to the loan administration panel such as a cancel button
  for the current search action.

- Incorrect Font when saving settings (while not having changed the font settings)
- Issue with web application where read only user only sees ID values for drop downs.
- Issue with extracting ISBN information from PDF files (old libraries updated to current
  versions - thanks Gene!).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.10.1  [Released on May 23 2013]  [testing: moderate]  [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Image not saved when updated through an online service.
- Saving the field settings for property modules also changes the quick view settings of
  the currently active module
- Table view shows the same column multiple times.
- Mass Update does not save images.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.10  [Released on May 18 2013]  [testing: high]  [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks mrpenguin007 for the updated German translation!
See http://sourceforge.net/projects/inventarverwalt/ for the module he has created.

This release mainly focuses on the help file, which has been greatly improved.
During the writing of the help file the discovered issues have been fixed. Small 
improvements to the GUI have been made to improve the experience in using Data Crow.
This is the first release since a long time having a completely up to date help.
Note that the help is still only available in English; translators are very welcome 
to help out.

[Fixed]
- No ShortCut created by the installer for Windows 64bit version.
- The log file is created initially in an incorrect location.
- Create multiple not working for any non music track modules.
- Issue where images are not always imported for items part of the imported main module.
- Container sometimes can't be saved.
- Loan shows incorrect period in case no due date has been set.
- Loan text shows "item is due on null" in case the due date is empty.
- Size of the help screen was not remembered.
- Resizing the settings view caused the application to crash.
- Date operators for the filter were not correct for dates.
- Passwords always needed to be entered in upper case after changing it. Now it
  works correctly, case-sensitive, for NEW passwords. 
- The horizontal setting for the Quick Fields Setting did only work when working in the
  English language.
- Picture not shown on the Data Crow item after starting Data Crow for the very first 
  time on Linux systems.
- "Is Filled" and "Is Empty" operators for filters on multi-reference fields were
  not correct.
- Saving from the web client could go wrong. Fixed. 

[Changed]
- I have made a lot of improvements to the help text (F1). I have added links in there,
  pointing to the detailed help text where necessary, have added a lot of additional 
  information in general, screenshots, etc. This was 24+ hours of work, so you better 
  read all of it!
- Updated the German Translation. See http://sourceforge.net/projects/inventarverwalt/
- Removed the filter operator 'Equal' and 'Not Equal To' for multi-reference fields;
  already covered with contains and does not contain.
- The Item Importer now has a setting to disable the item merging.
- I have added a Settings menu to the property item views. From here you can make changes
  to the item form layout and adjust the field settings. This was the only part of 
  Data Crow where you could not make modifications.
- Better initial settings for the item forms of the property modules.
- Added a filter field to the property maintenance overviews.
- Improvement made for multi-reference fields item selector


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.9.26  [Released on May 12, 2013]  [testing: high]  [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Fixed an issue with the -userdir: parameter; relatives paths could not be used.
  The setting would always revert back to the installation dir which is not allowed to 
  be used.
- Module Exporter error for exporting items from related modules.
- Module Exporter exports all items assigned to containers. This is faulty since the main
  items are already exported. Container items should not be treated as normal children.
- XSD fix for the Item Export (it was not fully correct).
- Java 7 denies creating backups in the root folder of any drive. I have added a 
  message, preventing the root folder to be selected. Hopefully I find a real fix for this.
  The issue is with TrueZip. They have a newer version but that would force all users to
  start using Java 7, while I still want to support Java 6 as well.

[Changed]
- Added a restart message after the module has been imported successfully.
- When the system is upgraded the system will now also check whether there are new
  reports and/or resource (language) files available in the installation folder. If so, 
  Data Crow will ask if it is okay to copy the files over from the installation folder 
  to the user folder.
- Loan Administration would open very slowly in case you have many loans outstanding.
  Items are now loaded in a separate process and the progress is shown in the 
  progress bar. 
- Same as above, but then also for the lend items tab of the contact person.
- Settings are now stored per client. On startup a Unique ID for your system is generated
  and stored in the datacrow.properties file. The existing system settings are used as 
  a template for these new settings files. This allows multiple client to work in the
  same Data Crow user folder while not being effected by the settings done by other users.
  The module settings are still shared though.
- For Windows systems the default font has been changed to "Arial Unicode MS" for 
  foreign character support. This only applies to new installations.
- The Expert Form has been replaced by the Database Editor tool. This one now only has
  the SQL queries panel.
- The log form has been expanded to include system information (moved from the expert
  form).
- Removed some borders from the main screen.
- Changed some of the default settings, for new users, mostly for colors and the 
  default look and feel.
- Small improvement to the file structure tree panel.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.9.25  [Released on May 10, 2013]  [testing: high]  [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- More upgrade errors for old versions have been fixed. This time it's related to old
  columns still being present due to failed upgrades in the past. The upgrade process
  will now actively check for these and correct where necessary.
- Performance bug in the table view.
- Lend items in the loan administration are not shown by title.
- Sometimes the items in the quick view for the container items are not sorted 
  alphabetically. 

[Changed]
- Small change to the module selection panel.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.9.24  [Released on May 9, 2013]  [testing: high]  [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- References show without a name, sometimes...
- PDCR error when creating new items (item was created successfully)
- It was possible to create infinite loops in the hierarchical structure of the 
  containers when creating tree structures of 3 levels or deeper.
- NullPointerException when clicking the "New" button from within the container item
  form.
- When adding new children (such as tracks) the view was not always updated correctly.
- Quick view font and font sizes were not fully in line with the settings. Additionally
  the header text is now always 4 points larger as the text font.
- The space between the text and the icon was underlined (quick view and multi-reference
  fields in the item form).
- In the Dutch translation the categories field for Software Items was labeled as license.

[Changed]
- New layout of the main screen.
- Removed the JTattoo border in the menus.
- Removed a few icons from the toolbar.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.9.23  [Released on April 20, 2013]  [testing: high]  [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Sourceforge.net search did not work correctly.
- OFDB online search no longer retrieved the genres correctly.
- Templates cannot have image / image not saved.
- Startup error in case default data is present for non existing module.
- When selecting a new user directory through the parameters Data Crow does not set up the
  user folder. This results in you only having access to the user module.
- The directory for upgrade script was not yet transferred to the new user folder. 
  This was no problem for upgrading, however, for new conversion required Data Crow
  could not have any write privileges to these files. 
- Newly added fields (using the Alter Module Wizard) are now enabled by default in the
  general field settings. 

[Changed]
- Imdb.com movie search now uses ImdbApi.org instead of Imdb.com web site parsing.
  Language setting now only applies to the localized title name. All other texts, etc,
  will be retrieved in English. This is a deliberate change as the web parsing is very
  error prone and hard to maintain. Note that you are limited to 3000 searches per hour.
- Items shown for the container module are now sorted alphabetically.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.9.22  [Released on April 29, 2013]  [testing: high]  [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Fixed multiple upgrade issues (not being able to log in after upgrade). The system
  will correct problems on startup for failed upgrades or else when newly upgrading.
- A check will be done on startup to correct, if necessary, any inconsistencies in the 
  database.
- Issue with the file importer; resource consumption has been lowered.
- Issue with the file importer; check whether an item already exists has been improved.
- Searching on ISBN for books does not work in case the ISBN contains an X.
- Fixed the CSV import for text containing a double quote character.
- Added checks for the Quick Filter.

[Changed]
- Updated version of the Italian translation from Marco Artioli (thanks!).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.9.21  [Released on February 10, 2013]  [testing: high]  [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Minor fixes for the restore process.
- Fix for the HSQL upgrade.
- Ratings from IMDB.com were no longer retrieved.

[Changed]
- Various small optimizations.  
- Updated the German translation - thanks to Norman Weimar
- Prevent users from selecting the installation folder as the user folder. The user 
  folder is and was meant to separate the installation folder from the user folder.
  Mostly because the OS these days add additional security to the installation folders
  not allowing ordinary users to change files. You can still select a folder inside
  off the Data Crow installation folder.
  
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.9.20  [Released on February 02, 2013]  [testing: high]  [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Changed the restore and backup process to support backups larger than 4.28GB with the
  use of TrueZip.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.9.19  [Released on January 18, 2013]  [testing: high]  [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Users can now safely upgrade from version 3.8.16 and early; without losing of pictures.
- Small uses during upgrades in general such as an empty log form shown after 3 or more 
  upgrade scripts.
- Title rewriter and name rewriter work again. There was an issue after the upgrade
  of the database engine.

[Changed]
- It is not possible to specify the user directory relative to the Data Crow installation 
  folder. Start the name with a dot (.) to make the path relative to the installation 
  folder; ./data or .\data. This only works for the -userdir: parameter.
- The File Importer now allows the online search to always pick the first result.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.9.18  [Released on January 18, 2013]  [testing: high]  [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pfew, the changes I made took quite a number of releases. I hope to have it under control
now. The backup and restore now works correct again. The issue with the upgrade of the 
database not working is mainly a security issue on the various platforms. The only 
solution is, when prompted, to run the command as stated in the message box from the 
command line / command prompt / terminal.

[Fixed]
- Backup and restore ignores custom made modules.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.9.17  [Released on January 12, 2013]  [testing: high]  [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Changed]
- Improved module importer

[New]
- Added a parameter "-userdir:" to overwrite the determination of the user directory
  altogether. This allows for running multiple instances of Data Crow looking at 
  separate user directories.

[Fixed]
- Start up errors for new installations of Data Crow.
- Module images not shown on the web due to incorrect path in user directory.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.9.16  [Released on January 11, 2013]  [testing: high]  [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[New]
- You can now select a user folder where all data is stored. This helps in avoiding the
  Windows problem of protected folders in the C:\Program Files\ folders as well as 
  protected folders on other systems. On startup you will be asked to select the user 
  folder. After selecting the folder Data Crow will migrate your data to this folder
  and will use this folder from then on.

[Fixed]
- Upgrade error for Linux users.
- Icons not shown in the multi-reference fields.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.9.15  [Released on January 6, 2013]  [testing: high]  [target: production]

Data Crow 3.9.2  [Released on January 7, 2011]  [testing: high]  [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Could not sort on actors, authors, artists and other multiple-references fields.
  Note that the items are sorted based on the first entry of the multiple references
  field. So if you have assigned two actors to a movie, Jan Jansen and Richard Howard,
  the first entry will be used to sort the item (in this case Jan Jansen). 
  Technically this has been accomplished by store the first string representation in 
  a separate field which is used to base the sort on. This field is kept in synch with 
  changes made (cleared in case no entries, updated with first entry in all other cases).
- Countries and properties could not be edited.
- Items not removed from the card view after saving them.
- Container tree does not get updated correctly with parent - child relationships.
- Unconfirmed fix; memory leak when importing movies file information.

  was closed and re-opened.

  actors and directors when working with imdb.com.

  not showing the whole text) 
- Web client advanced filter did not handle advanced filter correctly where no value is 
  required.

[Changed]
- Associates are now part of a specialized associates module. The create module wizard
  now allows you to select the 'person' module type.
- You can now configure the maximum number of actors to be retrieved when querying for
  movies from Imdb.com. Click on the configure button next to the server drop down to 
  change the value. By default all actors will be retrieved (old/current behavior).
- Fields can now be selected when exporting items (CSV/XML exports. Field selection is
  remembered for next time(s).
- Double-clicking a multiple references field now opens the select windows.
- Removed labels in quick view for images.
- Added additional filter operators for dates (today, days ago, days in the future,
  months ago and years ago.

[Known Issues]
- Removed the settings for persons (default sort order and display options); these
  did not work and need to be re-implemented. Planned for next version.

Data Crow 3.9.1  [Released on January 3, 2011]  [testing: high]  [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The "Happy New Year!" additions.. ;-)

Building upon the changes made in Data Crow 3.9 this release offers more performance
improvements and fixes.

[Changed]
- Within the Amazon Server Configuration you can now enter your AWS Access Key ID and 
  the Secret Key. By default a shared access key is used which can cause timeouts when
  multiple users are trying to query the server. Registering to the AWS site will provide
  you with your very own access key. Accounts can be registered here:
  http://aws.amazon.com/
- Icons are now shown in both the Quick View and the Item Form.

[Fixed]
- Values removed after saving an item using 'save all' from the tool bar.
- Any '&' character used in the module wizard caused Data Crow to crash when restarting.
- Data Crow slows down when switching between modules or filter fields;
  when the quick filter was build the list of possible items was retrieved. In case of
  10.000 or more actors (for example) this would take about 30 seconds to be filled. 
  Now, this only takes a couple of seconds.
- Very slow working "Advanced Filter" editing. Basically the same issue as mentioned 
  above; when the select box is filled with for example 10.000 actors Data Crow would
  crawl to a halt.
- Very slow working "Web Server". Same issue as mentioned above, related to retrieval
  of values for the quick and advanced filters.
- Added re-use of database connections for better performance.
- Extremely slow module importer.
- Items not removed from the table view when saving new items.
- Improved the speed for deleting massive numbers of items.
- Improved the speed for saving massive numbers of new items.
- Fixed issues where view would loose focus when saving updates.
- Icons are now cached. On first startup you might experience a slow down when starting
  the system. Second startup will eliminate this slow down.
- The character "'" in a field definition would break the reporting module
- The character "&" in a field definition would break the XML module, causing Data Crow
  to crash
- IMDB added a trailing space behind the title of a movie
- Not all genres of a movie were imported from IMDB
- Cannot launch files from the quick view panel
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.9.0  [Released on November 15, 2010]  [testing: high]  [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This release delivers a significant, mostly technical, change. The data layer, which 
is the way for Data Crow to load and display items, has been rewritten.
Items were always loaded (all of them) on startup, causing a long startup time and 
high memory usage.  

The new data layer increases the startup time of the product and lowers the memory 
requirements. On the down side you might notice a slight performance decrease when 
scrolling up and down in the views. This is because Data Crow now loads the items
when they become visible on screen. Due to a smart caching mechanism the performance
decrease has been kept as minimal as possible. On the plus side the grouping pane and
the startup time have improved significantly (by about 75%). Additionally it is now
possible to load a large database just as quickly as a small database, with the
same memory requirements!

The following has a direct impact on the performance of the system:
- The number of selected field as the description for an item 
  (View Settings > Description). Data Crow only queries for the necessary information,
  having to query for, for example, a name, category and a container will take 
  more time when loading the item on screen.
- Available memory for Data Crow (Java -Xmx256m is recommended).

New System Requirements:
- Minimum amount of memory: 128MB
- Recommended amount of memory 256MB.
- Sun Java 1.6 or higher.

[Known issues]
- Java will start consuming a lot of the processor time when the application is running 
  out of memory. Assign 256MB's to the application to make sure that this does not happen.

[Changed]
- Improved startup time (75% faster)
- Lower memory usage (50 to 70%)
- Items are always loaded directly from the database, no caching
- Grouping pane improvements (50% faster)
- Unique identifiers are now generated according to the UUID Java standards.
  (For future compatibility)
- Added indexes on database tables. This done automatically, also for custom modules.
- Items are only loaded if and when they are actively shown on screen.
- Changed the layout of the quick view.
- Updated Apache FOP to version 1.0; increased performance for report creation.

- Pictures are now shown within the quick view panel. If a picture field is added 
  to the description of the quick view panel it will no longer be displayed in a 
  separate tab.
- Toolbar can now be completely disabled (F12).
- Garbage collection scheduler is now disabled by default. If needed it can be turned
  on in the expert user dialog.
- Fields in view settings and grouping pane can now be ordered without having to 
  remove and add the fields again.
- Added m4a to the music file importer.
- Added an option to enable high quality rendering of images (lowers performance and
  increases memory usage).
- Improved performance for the chart panel.
- Using JFreeChart libraries instead of OpenChart2, allowing for better graphical 
  chart presentations and printable charts.
- An option has been added to the quick view settings to show or hide the picture tabs.
  This is a 'per module' setting.

[Changed]
- Updated Italian language pack (big thanks to Marco Artioli).

[Fixed]
- Update all was not available from the tools menu.
- Web Server cannot be started from the command line.
- Item cannot be deleted after opening it from within the child tab of the item form.
- Item of custom module with child relation cannot be deleted. Data Crow states that

  missing field the UI fails to initialize correctly and causes Data Crow to shutdown. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.8.10  [Release on 16/02/2010] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Known performance issues will be fixed with the 4.0 version. These cannot be solved
in the current Data Crow 3 version.

[Fixed]
- Bol.com was no longer working (item links on bol.com were changed).
- Altering a module made the file fields disappear (the property 'file-backed' was not 
  saved correctly).
- The FreeDB server did not deliver helpful error message when the disc query failed.
- The error handling of the report creation process has been improved. 
- Data Crow did not remember (after a restart) whether its main view was maximized.
- Table view duplicates tracks when saving a new item.
- The list disappears when altering a property from within one of the administration 
  menu options.
- Forms for child modules cannot be designed (the menu item is not available).

[Changed]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.8.9  [Release on 13/02/2010] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Known performance issues will be fixed with the 4.0 version. These cannot be solved
in the current Data Crow 3 version.

[Fixed]
- Imdb.com was no longer working.
- Audio Tracks were no longer updated by the online search and synchronizer.
- Flickering pictures in the view.
- Log file created in the old location (previous installation of Data Crow).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.8.8  [Release on 05/02/2010] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Memory issues with the images module.
- Photo of persons not shown in the picture tab of the quick view.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.8.7  [Release on 06/01/2010] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Changed]
- Mass updater will first search for an item using the unmodified title or name of the 
  item. If no results were found for the specific item Data Crow will try and clean up
  the title and find a match. Additionally the logging has been improved; the log will
  tell you if a match was using which search string.
- Added meaningful tool tips for all menu and tool bar items.
- Improved error handling for startup errors.

[New]
- Added a new wizard; Tool Select. This wizard helps new users in selecting the right
  tool for the job they want to perform.
  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.8.6  [Release on 31/12/2009] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contains for the most part bug fixes but also introduces changes to the image module.

[Fixed]
- Incorrect translation of tabs in the software module (only fixed for new installations)
- Several small memory leaks concerning images.
- Image not always saved; newly added image are marked as updated images causing them
  to be discarded.
- Cannot perform online search for items having a ' in the name.
- Picture not shown in the images detail page of the web GUI.
- Local art tab is shown for the image importer.
- Data Crow cannot be started after installing it without the modules.

[Changed]
- Images are no longer copied in their unmodified state to the Data Crow images folder.
  The image will now first be scaled (400x400).
- The link to the original image is now used to display the original image (if it is 
  available).
- A new option has been added to the file importer: save directly. This option adds 
  items directly to the database, bypassing the new item tab. This saves both time and
  memory.
- Selected server, mode and region are now remembered for the Mass Update functionality.
- Queries as entered in the online search form are now used in their unmodified form.
- You can quickly add a new drive (directory or network location) from within the 
  File Import dialog.
- Quick filter toolbar; you can now search for child items 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.8.5  [Release on 9/12/2009] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Discogs.com online service no longer retrieved the tracks.
- Memory leak in the card view. Data Crow will now use a maximum amount of memory.
  After that, additional memory is actively released to the system.
- File size is cleared when saving an item of which the file does not exist.
- [2909635] Failure after installing without modules. Data Crow can now actually be 
  started without having any of the default modules available.
- Non picture fields are displayed in the pictures settings for the card view.
- [2909608] Cannot delete empty back picture.
- [2909589] Update all still malfunctioning.
- [2909593] Null Pointer Exception when importing Movies
- [2909591] No directory sort order in Movie import dialog

[Changed]
- Selected container and storage medium for the file importer is now remembered for a 
  next run.
- Default picture order for the card view has been corrected (front, media, back).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.8.4  [Release on 3/12/2009] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Update all was no longer working.
- I had to remove the skin look and feel options. The performance of Data Crow in 
  combination with the skin look and feel is very bad compared to the normal look and
  feels.
- The cards in the card view have been made bigger. This also fixes the issue where
  images are clipped / displayed partially. 
- Images exported by the item exporter and the reporting tool were corrupted.
- Report creation process could not be canceled. 
- Online update duplicates tracks. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.8.3  [Release on 26/11/2009] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Related modules are not correctly imported using the module import wizard.
- Hierarchy container tree does not update correctly when changing the parent of a 
  container. 
- Invalid container hierarchies are not prevented (unending loop).
- Update all does not update items when the validation of an item fails.
  This is fine but no error is shown to the user.
- NullpointerException when deleting a custom made module (rarely occurs).
- Imdb.com online service was no longer working.
  Cobra project: Imdb.com HTML was no longer valid for this library. The cobra.jar 
  library has been altered to correct this. 
- Changes made to the contact person module were saved to the wrong module JAR file.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.8.2  [Release on 17/11/2009] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe I am taking the 'release often' approach to its very limits.. here is yet 
another minor release containing small fixes and an additional online service.

[Fixed]
- Genres for movies retrieved by IMDB were, sometimes, appended by " more". 
- Sorting: sort settings overruled the sorting of a filter created in the filter dialog.
  Now this filter dialog sorting is remembered. Changing the sort after applying a filter
  overrules the sorting of the filter. 
- Description was not retrieved for software from Sourceforge.

[Changed]
- Updated Italian translated. Thanks Marco Artioli! 
- Added a new reference to the software module: License.

[New]
- Softpedia online service. Retrieves information on drivers and Linux, Mac, 
  windows and game (related) titles. Together with the previous new online services 
  (Sourceforge.net and FreeBookSpot) Data Crow now offers information on downloadable 
  (free) content instead of solely using the online service to retrieve information on
  commercial titles. You can expect more of these kind of services to be added in the
  near future.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.8.1  [Release on 15/11/2009] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Categories and such could still be deleted even when used by other items.
- French translation was added incorrectly to the installer package (sorry Skorpionnan)!
- Errors when trying to delete an item (Date cannot be cast to collection of DcObject). 
- Quick View does not display the item when the contact person module has been disabled.
- Error in queries when only references have been changed for an item.
- Only 10 custom property modules could be created. In the new setup you can have an 
  unlimited amount of custom property modules. 
- Cache is now always cleared when upgrading from an older version.
- Possible error during module import; importer tries to update a view which is created\
  only after restarting Data Crow.
- Item importer (XML) failed when a field name (XML tag) started with a numeric value.
  These fields are now appended by 'fld-' to create a valid XML tag. 

[Changed]
- Added the file backed and the container managed properties to the module wizard.
  These option were already available but only by editing the module XML manually.
  The file backed property adds the file size, file hash, hash type and file name field
  to the module. The container managed property adds a container field to the module
  and allows the items belonging to this module to be displayed within the container
  module. 
    

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.8  [Release on 10/11/2009] [testing: moderate] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 3.7 version contained errors which were not noticed while the 3.7 was in its
beta stage. This release fixes 'all' of these issues. Note that this version has only be 
tested moderately. 

[New]
- Metacritic game and movie online service. An excellent resource for game and movie
  reviews.
- FreeBookSpot online service. A site from which e-books can be downloaded.
- Added sourceforge.net as an online service. Sourceforge.net hosts open source projects
  like Data Crow and many others.

[Changed]
- Invalid auto numberers are now automatically removed on startup. They can become 
  invalid due to removal of the field from the module.
- Added additional checks to see if an item was destroyed. Picture objects are now 
  also internally recycled.
- The drive scanner and drive poller (part of the Drive Manager) can now be configured
  (from within the Drive Manager dialog) to run on startup. 
- The category field of the software module has been changed to a multi-reference field.
- Items can no longer be deleted when referenced by other items.

[Fixed]
- Reserved keywords could be used as module and field names causing all kinds of startup
  errors. Data Crow now actively checks whether the name is allowed.
- NullPointerExceptions when starting Data Crow and while working with items in 
  the views.
- Grouping pane looses its grouping.
- Picture disappears when updating a newly added item. 
- Strange images being written to HTML reports.
- NullPointerException when creating a report.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.7  [Release on 07/11/2009] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No new functionality but a lot of memory and performance improvements. The changes
made cause a dramatic performance increase as well as a substantial memory gain.

This list of changes and fixes is the combined list of this and the 3.7 beta release.

[Changed]
- Increased the speed of the file synchronizer.
- Items are now internally reused. Data Crow was quite generous when it came to item 
  instances. To gain, I admit, a modest performance and memory usage gain items
  are now internally re-usable. As a user you will not really see this change. However,
  this change has such a big impact on the whole of the product that I have decided to
  release this version as a major release and to release it as a beta version first.   
- Several performance fixes have been applied. The external references and the additional
  checks performed when saving an searching for items caused the performance to drop.
  To overcome these issues (for large databases) the checks to see whether an item 
  already exists have been changed; 
  * For properties both the alternative names and the names are checked.
  * For all other items the external references are checked first (the PDCR in particular).
    Secondly a (combination of) display field is checked. Since version 3.5 Data Crow
    only checks on the actual string (exact match but case insensitive). This has been
    kept this way.
- Views are now filled instantly resulting in a 99% performance improvement. With this 
  change items are added to the view in about a second (regardless of the amount of items). 
- View components are now reused (reduction of item creation; lesser memory needed and 
  performance improvement).  
- Memory needed for viewing all items now requires about 75% lesser memory. This is not
  a fixed memory gain as it also depends whether the items contain an image (etc.).
- Save buttons are now removed from the item tabs of the view. Save and save all is still
  available from the menu bar and the tool bar.
- Update all now saves the updates directly (!).  
- Displaying dialogs is now more controlled (technical change).

[Fixed]
- Templates could not be saved.
- Templates are not correctly displayed in the view.
- Template form does not show tabs as defined for the item itself.
- Images not displayed in the web application if the images/modules folder does 
  not exist.
- Reference values such as actors and genres could not be saved (introduced by 3.7 beta).
- Picture disappears when lending an item. The image reappeared after restarting 
  Data Crow (introduced by 3.7 beta).
- External Reference is not created when an item is updated by an online service.
- Several problems with transparent images have been fixed.
- MobyGames.com stopped working.
- Items are not correctly updated in the tree / grouping pane.
- Key navigation in table view.
- Issues with update all functionality when loosing view focus.
- Data Crow hangs after message "want to save changes" when navigating in the grouping 
  pane.
- By default the directory usage has been turned on for the File Importer. Has been
  changed to off by default.
- Calendar displays February twice if the current day of the months is greater than 28.
- "Hanging startup" on some Linux flavors.
- Several references in text to Java 1.5; should be Java 1.6.    
  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow BETA 3.7  [Release on 30/10/2009] [testing: medium] [target: BETA]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No new functionality but a lot of memory and performance improvements. The changes
made cause a dramatic performance increase as well as a substantial memory gain.

Note that this is a beta version; limited testing has been performed! Please create a
backup of your database before using this version.

Data Crow 3.6 [Release on 18/10/2009] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! Note: The minimum Java version is now Java 6 (also known as Java 1.6).
! Special thanks to David Marín for delivering the Spanish translation.

[New]
- A Spanish translation. Donated by David Marín. 
- New feature for the File Import of e-books. The importer will now try and find the ISBN
  that is contained in the PDF document. For this the ISBN Extractor 
  (http://isbnextractor.sourceforge.net) is used.
- Each item can now have one or more external keys. External keys, such as ASINs from 
  Amazon, are used to link the item from the source where they were obtained from. 
  They add additional flexibility and lend themselves to be used by other systems and 
  customization.
  This solves problems where items could not be linked to the source system and were
  therefore duplicated. Most notable example are the actors for IMDB movies. 
  The name was used to check whether the actor already existed in Data Crow. This worked
  fine when the name is not changed on either side as this breaks the link between the
  Data Crow and the item of the source system. Now, the external IDs are used to link
  the items. Where there is no external ID available Data Crow uses an internally 
  generated item tag instead.
  In short: items are now more reusable then ever!
- Module Export Wizard. This wizard enables you to share your modules with other users.
  With this wizard it is now possible to export your custom made modules and their data.
  It creates a single archive which can be imported on any other Data Crow installation
  by using the Module Import Wizard. It exports the reports, items of the module(s) 
  (based on the settings), settings and reports (xsl).
- Module Import Wizard. Takes care of all the nitty gritty stuff that is involved when 
  you want to add a custom module to your Data Crow installation. This is, from now on,
  THE way to add custom modules to your installation. It takes care of internal module
  ID clashes, imports the items belonging to the module(s) and imports all other related
  information (such as the default settings and reports).
- Module Copy Wizard. Tired of adding all the fields manually to your custom module?
  Why not base it on one of the existing modules? Use this wizard, select the module 
  which you would like to copy and off you go!
- A new parameter has been added: -datadir:<directory>. This parameter can be used to 
  specify an alternative location for the data folder of Data Crow. Note that the images
  will still be written to webapp/datacrow/mediaimages (in the installation folder).
  Substitute spaces by %20.
- Container hierarchy: Containers can now be assigned a parent, allowing users to create
  a hierarchical container structure. The grouping pane of the container view has two 
  additional options: 'Flat view' and 'Hierarchical View'. 
- File operations: The view popup menu and the file launcher field have a new menu
  called 'File'. Here you'll find five new options:
  * Move file: moves the actual file and updates the filename of the item.
  * Delete file: deletes the actual file and clears the filename of the item.
  * Locate file: three options to locate a file using the drive manager. This is a 
    convenient way to locate an individual file that has been moved. The functionality
    uses the drive manager functionality and offers to match on filename, filename +
    file size or on file size + hash. 
- Each property can now have alternative values. This is convenient in case you want to make
  sure that properties retrieved by online services are mapped to your own properties. 
  The alternative values have to be entered separated by ';' characters. The input needs to
  start and end with a ';' character.
- A new book online search: ISBNdb.com. This online service retrieves the book information
  from ISBNdb.com and the front cover from Amazon.com.

[Changed]
- Added additional font rendering options (Settings > Settings > Font).
- File and URL launcher: both have been updated to use the Java 1.6 methods for launching 
  files and URLs. Additionally the feedback to the user has been improved in case the file
  or URL cannot be opened.
- Quick View: URLs are now displayed as "link" instead of mentioning the full URL.
  This also fixes the issue where text in the Quick View is not being wrapped.
- File Importer now remembers whether it should use online services or not + the selected
  server, search mode and region.
- File Importer now remembers the selected "directory usage". 
- Quick View: filename is now a click-able link with the filename (excluding the path) as
  text.
- Default data is now loaded right after the data layer has been initialized instead of 
  during the database creation process. This delivers greater control on the load process
  of default data.
- Floppy drives are no longer ignored (due to the upgrade to Java 6).
- ASIN fields have been removed from the movie, software, audio CD and music album modules.
  The ASINs have been migrated to the new external references field.
- Disc ID fields have been removed from the audio CD and music album modules. The Disc IDs
  have been transferred to the new external references field. 
- Updated several of the icons for the property modules.
- The individual 'maintain' view popup menu options have been put in a separate 'maintain' 
  menu.
- The property modules 'edition type' and 'binding' for books are no longer contained in the
  modules folder. They are created within the system instead (same as all other system 
  property modules). The editiontype.jar and binding.jar files are removed on startup.
- The movie module has obtained addition fields; color and aspect ratio.
- IMDB online search now retrieves the color, aspect ratio and language.
- Amazon service now retrieves the color (if available) and the aspect ratio.
- Ofdb.de now adds an external reference to the item on the IMDB.com page.
- Icons_user directory has been removed. Icons_system folder is now called icons.
- Default data (demo data) can now also be an XML file. 
- The Dutch translation has been updated.
- The help has been updated.

[Fixed]
- "Pick a Date": larger set of years to make the navigation easier + a fix for the up and 
  down error of the year (both went back in time). 
- XML Export: Dates are now always exported like so: yyyy-MM-dd. This prevents problems
  when importing dates into other systems.
- IMDB online service: when a movie has several countries it is imported as a single
  country (item "USA, The Netherlands" instead of two separate items).
- Several encoding issues for the online services.
- Exported items using the XML exported can not be imported on a system using a different
  language pack.
- Online Search: the setting 'values to retrieve' is completely ignored 
  when the setting 'retrieve full item details on initial run' is switch off. 
- Discogs online search did no longer retrieve the tracks and other information. The
  Discogs site was changed and this broke the online service. This one has been
  reimplemented.  
  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.5.1 [Release on 26/09/2009] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- File size for file hashing now allows larger file sizes to be set. Setting the value to
  zero will now allow hashes to be created for files of any size.
- After doing a mass update of, for example, audio CD's the artists and such were 
  mentioned twice. After a restart everything returned to normal.
- The FPS for MPEG 1 and 2 movies was off by a factor of a thousand frames. There is
  no update performed on old information; the fix only works for newly imported movies.
- Timeout on online searches has been removed; the result was a not updated movie after
  10 seconds without knowing the reason why. Especially true when performing and online
  search in combination with the "retrieve additional information for companies 
  and persons" setting (which might actually take more then 10 seconds).
- Additional check for locked databases. Added a check for the settings of the database.
- IMDB import: some runtime of the imported run times are incorrect (of by tens of hours).
- Splitting the names of IMDB persons is incorrect. Only true for names ending with 
  a number like so: Harry Potter (1).
- Sorting did not work correctly for the container module.
- Possible issue with scrolling in views (inverted up and down scrolling).
- Occasional error while performing an amazon online search: 
  Incomplete trailing escape (%) pattern 
- Barnes & Nobles online search was once again broken.

[Changed]
- The database no longer runs in a locked mode. This means you can start multiple 
  sessions of Data Crow or run both the web server in console mode and the Data Crow 
  GUI. Optimistic locking is used for database records (who ever saves the data 
  overwrites data saved by the other user working on the same record).
- Changed the description retrieved for actors (better styled, removed boilerplate 
  text).
- Removed boilerplate text for movies retrieved by Imdb.com and ofdb.de.
- Module wizard: from now on newly created modules can be reused within relationships.
  In previous versions a created module, such as a property module, could only be used
  once for a reference field. Now you can actually create one property module and use 
  this module (and it's data) for reference fields of multiple other modules.
  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.5 [Release on 20/09/2009] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The distribution has been changed. There is no longer a separate Web Module package.
Instead all have been merged together. This makes the distribution a bit larger but puts
the web module a bit more into the spotlight. The installer offers the option to exclude
the web module. The zipped distribution contains, of course, everything (including the
web module).

Thanks to Ingo Macherius for designing and donating the new movie report 
(List Report (xvids) and for helping to test the upgrade process.

[Fixed]
- The version checker does not recognize 3.5 as being a higher version then 3.4.19.
- ISBN search with ISBN's containing non-digits now also (finally) works.
- Movie import "settings" Tab: Storage Medium items are gone.
- Encoding issue in IMDB import. 
- Bol.com did no longer retrieve the description (page was changed).
- Incorrect font for drop-down / list boxes.
- Contact person drop-down / list box remains empty (loan administration).
- Could not set an empty value for a drop-down field.
- Web Server: Module icons are not refreshed when changing the icons using the 
  module wizards.
- Web Server: Large module icons shown for helper modules. 
- General errors while retrieving results from IMDB.com and Amazon
  (empty message pops up and a NullPointerException is logged).
- Year was not always set for IMDB movie results.
- Alapage.com online search has been removed. The page has been redesigned making 
  it necessary to create a new implementation. This will be done in a later version. 
- MusicBrainz search: titles of album and tracks start with a new line character.
 
[Changed]
- File import for e-books: if the filename contains an ISBN it is used to query the
  online service.
- Online Search: if the query contains an ISBN it is used to query the item.
- Mass Update: if the item contains an ISBN it is used to query the item.
- Audio CD search (Amazon): when an album consists of multiple CD's the album is no 
  longer duplicated. Instead all tracks are added to one album 
  (with the correct numbering). 
- Amazon search has been updated and (coding wise) simplified. 
- Server Settings; online servers can now have individual settings. The amazon
  server can now be configured to retrieve user reviews (or not).

  edition comment. 

[New]

  Windows platforms. I would like to thank François Rey for supplying the code for the 
  'directory as drives' functionality.
- The software, music album, audio CD, book and movie module have 2 new fields:
  language and country.  
- Two new property modules: country and language.
- An additional movie report (List Report (xvids)) has been added.

Data Crow 3.4.10 [Release on 17/06/2009] [testing: high] [target: production]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.4.9 [Release on 14/06/2009] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'd like to thank the following contributors: Marco Artioli, Mathias Epp and 
Tomáš Polomský.

[Fixed]

Data Crow 3.4.9 [Release on 02/06/2009] [testing: moderate] [target: beta]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[New]
- Italian translation! Thanks to Marco Artioli!
- Updated german translation! Thanks to Mathias Epp!
- Data Crow's web server can now be started without showing the UI. The normal parameter
  'webserver' in combination with the new credentials parameter hides the splash screen 
  and bypasses the login dialog. See the readme on how to apply these parameters.
- The item form has it's own settings dialog. From here you can define tabs (such as 
  the current information and technical information), assign fields to tabs and set
  the order of the fields. The general field settings has lost the ability to set
  the field order as this was only used by the item form.
- In the previous versions the uniqueness of an item was determined by checking the
  combination of the required fields. Now this behavior can be managed by marking fields
  as key fields. By default, none of the fields is marked as a key field. 
- The file importer considered a fixed set of file types. The functionality has been 
  expanded to allow the user to define additional file types.
- Icons are now shown in the tree view.
- The alter module wizard now allows for fields to be changed as well. Upgrades are managed
  automatically.
- You can now map a drive letter / location to a new location. Settings > Drive Mappings.
- The help now has search capabilities.
- The mass update functionality now supports all search modes.

[Changed]
- The default view can now be set per module. In previous versions this was a global 
  setting.
- Error handling for the file importers and the attach file information has been 
  improved.
- Containers can now have an icon assigned.

[Fixed]
- NullPointerException when clicking in an empty space of the field selection dialog.
- Error in the settings: long stored as integer.
- Unused columns, due to conversions in the past, will now be removed.
- NullPointerException when trying to use the Bol.com online search.
- Tracks were duplicated after updating an audio CD imported via the 
  'retrieve CD information' tool. 
- View not updated properly when switching between view types (without grouping).

  party coding).
- [2617165] NPE during IMDB movie import

  The check has been changed to a warning (which will only be shown once) after 
  which Data Crow will (try to) start normally.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]

  In previous versions this was possible.
- [2485347] Malformed URL syntax for pictures break reports. 
  Pictures are not correctly added to the reports (since Apache FOP 0.95). 
- [2464760] Inability to work with Cyrillic author names 
  Filter dialog allowed free form input for multi-relation fields 
  (which is not supported).
- [2487958] Report sort order after import

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.4.6 [Release on 02/01/2009] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to the overwhelming response and complaints about having to set the DATACROW_HOME
directory or to supply the -dir: parameter I have decided to change this with this early
release. Oh, and there's something new as well; a French translation! Big thanks to
Pierre-Yves DANTEC!

[New]
- French translation, with many thanks too Pierre-Yves DANTEC!

[Fixed]
- NullpointerException when closing the user form.
- Help cannot be shown.

[Changed]
- Data Crow will now try to determine the installation directory itself. If this fails
  it will fall back on the DATACROW_HOME environment variable or on the -dir: parameter.
  The environment variable and -dir: parameter overrule this behavior (if supplied, these
  will be used instead). Many users had problems with specifying the environment variable
  and this changed is meant to take the pain away.  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.4.5 [Release on 31/12/2008] [testing: high] [target: production]

- Incorrect Dutch / English translation resulted in incorrect action when closing an item 
  form with unsaved changed (lost in translation..).

- Data Crow is not always successful in finding its installation directory (see changes);
  Especially on Vista and Linux platforms.
- [2463925] Vista - Incorrect folder permissions
  Data Crow does not report anything when the folder permissions are not set correctly.
  This results in loss of data (Linux, Vista).

- Headers of tables were not translated.
- Loan information panel was not translated.
- Log file is created in a separate data folder.

Data Crow 3.4.4 [Release on 20/12/2008] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code has been reviewed and many small improvements have been made. As a result
of this, this version uses less memory and has once again an improved start up time.

I have been working quite hard to get the code documented. The emphasis for this release
is again.. quality! I was quite happy with the stability of the 3.4.3 version but not
with the amount of fixes needed to get there. 

Please note that a new version of the web module is available (version 1.2). This module
needs to be installed on top of Data Crow in order for the web module to be available.

loan information can now be viewed in a specialized dialog.
Items now show which items are using them; actors have a separate tab to show in which 
movies they have performed.
The FreeDB support has been re-added. It was present in older version and has now be 
delivered as a separate plugin (with limited support).

menu can be used to maintain genres and the likes and to view the loan information.

[Fixed]

[Changed]
- Contact persons can now be deleted after they have lend and/or returned items.
- Containers can now also be created from within the import dialog.
- Container view is now able to display the items directly from the grouping
  pane. The table view has been removed (obsolete for this module).
- Loan management, Due Date (1941130)
  Due date for loans. A due date can now be specified. A dialog has been added
  to show the statuses of loaned items. The overdue date can also be used in views.
  Two new fields are now added for each items: Date overdue and days till overdue.
  These fields can be used for filtering, etc.
- A new menu has been added called administration. This menu contains the 
  manage X menu items and the new loan information menu item.

  "Retrieve CD information". This functionality was present in older versions of Data 
  Crow (2.12) and was removed as it could no longer be supported. I have added the 
  functionality as a separate plugin. No additional support will be delivered for 
  this tool.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.4.0.1 [PATCH]  [Release on 08/09/2008] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This patch fixes the loan functionality.

[Fixed]
- [2100120] Lost "LoanedBy" movie.
- [2099205] Unable to check books in.
- [2089573] Incorrect layout of the File Import screen.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.4      [Release on 31/08/2008] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This version comes with new functionality, fixes and an improved upgrade process.
The improvements of the upgrade process are mainly due to the new version management.
When upgrading a warning will appear stating that the version of your database or
backup could not be determined. As long as you follow the upgrade paths it is safe
to ignore the message. After the first startup this message will no longer appear.

[New]
- Online services are now plugin based. Additional plugins can be delivered as jar 
  libraries which can be put in the services directory. The online services are no 
  longer bound to software version deliveries and can be released separately. 
  Data Crow will come however with a default online services pack.  
  Plans have been made to allow automatic updates.
- Clickable links in the quick view and the item form for faster navigation to 
  sub items (such as actors for movies)
- Container module. The location field has been replaced with a container field. 
  A container can be anything such as a CD, a CD box, a closet.. anything. On startup you 
  will be prompted to convert the locations to container items.
  This module will be expanded in the near future.
- File structure tree.

[Changed]
- Code review: filter operators rewrite, music album importer code reuse issue.
- Removed the following message box: "save succeeded".
- Removed the following message box: "no items have been found for xx" when searching for
  an item.
- The online search form will no longer close after adding a new item or updating an 
  existing one. It will now add the item(s) and clear the form. This allows users to do
  multiple searches without having to re-open the form every time. 
- Replaced Entagged with JAudioTagger for parsing information from music files.
  JAudioTagger has continued on the work of Entagged 
- Version numbering is no longer dependent on the settings file. The version is now kept
  (in a structured way) in the database.
- New backups now contain a version number. This will be used to check if a backup can
  be restored in the current version.
- Restoring an backup of an older version will now cause Data Crow to restart.
  A restore of a backup of the current version will not cause a restart. This has been
  changed to make sure older databases are correctly upgraded on startup. 
- Table view: removed line numbering. Removed horizontal grid lines.
- Settings views: removed line numbering.
- Quick view settings: added an option to set the background color. Removed the dependency
  of the background color towards the even/odd color of the view.
- View Setting: There were all kinds of dependencies towards the general field settings.
  Most of the option were not really clear. To overcome this each view has gained its very 
  own settings dialog. Everything for that view can be changed from there. Removed the 
  visible option from the field settings. Card view item description can now be set via the
  View Settings.
- Web Field Settings: Removed the dependency for the quick search fields towards the 
  general field settings. The web field settings now contains the option to use a field as a
  quick search field.
- Removed the question mark images for missing covers.
- caching of items to improve startup times. Instead of creating all the data sets on each
  startup the data sets are now written out to disk on shutdown and reloaded on startup.
  When upgrading or restoring a backup the cache will be ignored and the data sets will be
  recreated from the database (which is still the leading data store).
  Additionally, if needed for any reason), Data Crow can be started without using the cache
  by adding the parameter -nocache. Startup times are improved by 20% due to this change.
  The first startup however will still load the items from the database.
- Before and after for Dates
- Picture settings have been added to the Card View Settings. The shown picture no longer
  depends on the general field settings.
  
[Fixed]
- Sometimes items are not added to the view after a different node in the grouping pane
  has been selected.
- Database collation was incorrect by default causing Chinese characters (and others) to 
  be stored incorrectly. This is only fixed for new installations.
- Faster image loading for the card view. It now uses less memory and has a better
  performance.
- [2039920] "Update all" empties fields
- [2039948] Save from "online search" issue
- [2032102] Threading issue with saving IMDB movie actors
- [2027395] Incorrect label for "manage states" (music album/track)
- [2030645] Front picture not shown in card view (sometimes)
  Empty images are stored causing empty pictures to be displayed (incorrectly fixed in
  the beta version).
- [2029825] Updating old record empty fields doesn't work
- [2029628] Online update on actor inside the movie module fails
- [2029637] Can't cancel changes
- [2034988] Can't re-attach Quick filter widget
- [2039939] "update all" not fully applied (view changes)
- [2005182] Initial Start Up
- [1995128] Upgrade error
- [2055353] Uncaught NPEs
- [2063861] Very Slow, uses 100% of CPU. 
  The startup time for databases containing a high number of items (20.000+) has been
  increased dramatically (from minutes to seconds). Additionally a caching mechanism has
  been introduced which further improves the starting time by about 20% on a seconds run.
- Screen lockups. Threads were running with a maximum priority causing them to get a higher
  priority then other Windows threads. This caused Data Crow to become inresponsive.
- Message box is sometimes shown on the wrong form causing the current window to loose 
  its focus.
- Pressing escape in the mainframe bypasses the check for changes.
- Incorrect message when exiting Data Crow.
  Changed the message to "There are unsaved changes. Are you sure you want to exit?"
  when exiting Data Crow.
- Fixed several possible startup issues for Linux platforms. (preventing messageboxes
  to block the screen while the splash screen is being shown).
- Fixed non fatal nullpointer errors on startup. 
- Version number was not written to the settings file making it unusable for future
  reference (upgrading).
- Messages for upgrades were not in the center of the screen.
- Improved error handling for the upgrade processes. Better information and warnings
  when the database is of an older version.
- After removing the properties/settings file the system asks to perform unwanted 
  upgrades.
- Continuous scrolling in the card view, online search and manage item x forms.
- When hiding the grouping pane all views are re-filled. This makes Data Crow very 
  slow and does not abide to the standard behavior. Only the views of the current 
  module should  be refilled. 
- Incorrect display of the module permissions (user form).
- Deleted child items still shown in the view.
- Nullpointer after closing the image editor.
- Navigation buttons for the field settings, quick view settings and the web field
  settings were incorrectly aligned.  
- Tabs are hard to distinguish.
- Discogs: images not retrieved.
- Discogs: for some albums empty tracks are added.
- Performance bug when filling a view with items with children.
- Button alignment for the question message box (yes/no). 
- ISBN 10 calculation was incorrect.
- Starting a file import multiple times results in the previous items to be added
  to the new tab again. 
- Barnes & Nobles online search did no longer recover the title.
- Old items are loaded when restoring an old backup. Cache should be cleared after
  each restore. 
- Query error when searching for titles (etc) containing a ' character. 
- Created and modified date were stored as strings making it impossible to create 
  filters (like before and after) on them.
- Incorrect filter operators for numbers and dates (contains, etc).
- (Beta bug) reports still contained the location field (changed to container)
- Adding a new module does not load the new items (cache should not be used)
- Nullpointer in the File Renamer.
- Music Album importer creates empty albums.
- Memory leak in the image import.

Data Crow 3.3      [Release on xx/06/2008] [testing: moderate] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[New]
- This version supports the web module (which has been released at the same time of 
  this version). The web server can be found (after the web module has been installed)
  in the web server menu.
- Bol.com movie search (Dutch titles).

[Fixed]
- Typos in messages
- Right-click in the view changes the selection incorrectly. 
  Fixed by only changing the selection of no item has been currently selected or the
  selected item count equals 1.
- Update all did not work correctly due to the above mentioned bug.
- Scaled images were incorrectly stored. The format is not supported by external 
  applications. The upgrade process will ask to convert these incorrect images.
- The help text for the software item mass update stated incorrectly that a match is
  needed on both the title and the platform. Only a match on the title is needed. 
- Picture in the quick view disappears after double clicking it (opens the item form,
  after closing this form (without saving) the picture is no longer displayed).
- Exit of Data Crow after a restore (without any warning). The restore was however
  successful.
- Hash calculation consumed too much memory. Replaced with JackSum functionality.
  The maximum file size (for performance tweaking) for hash calculation can be set.
  Default has been set to 40MB. 
- Wrong item form is opened (example: user) when double-clicking on the quick 
  view panel.
- NullpointerException: Media module > Create New > Make no selection / close dialog.
- Incorrect default settings (fix for new installations only). 
- Chart tab is displayed for developers / actors /.. while no fields can be selected.
  Chart tab should not be visible for these modules.
- Fixed a bug which caused the 'Attach file information' function to crash on very 
  large files (2GB +).
- Buttons not fully displayed in the settings view.
- [1958448] Same field can be created twice using the module wizard. The second field
- Better cleanup of garbage from titles for imported items.
- File launcher field tries to launch an empty file (NullPointerException).
- Directory usage of the music file import did not work correctly for every situation.
- Local Art dialog misses help text.

[Changed]
- Mass update now allows to update either all items currently shown in the view or
  the currently selected items.
- The hash calculation can now be set in the settings dialog. Supported hash types
  are: EDK, MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and many, many others. The hash and the hash type are 
  stored for every item.
- Online Search for the importer now always checks for a perfect match.
- File import file / directory selection has been changed.
- File import dialog has been re-designed.
- WMA support has been enabled for the music album module.
- All person modules gained a first- and last name field. These fields will be 
  automatically 'calculated' on first startup. The old name fields now serve as 
  full name fields and are left unmodified. 
- Added EAN field for software, audio CDs and movies.
- You can now enter words to remove from the title when importing files. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.2.2.1  [Release on 05/05/2008] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Fixed]
- Incorrect layout for the quick view panel (comma characters are replaced by newlines). 
- The tree panel does not sort the leafs correctly for fields like genres.
- View is refreshed after an update. (only happens when the highest node in the tree
  view is selected).
- Improved startup time (performance change/fix).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.2.2  [Release on 04/05/2008] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance has been increased and again some important bug fixes. The main changes are
in the file import; local art can now be imported and all file importers can now also 
perform an online search.

[Fixed]
- Incorrect font used for the module settings.
- Incorrect image displayed in the list view.
- Table view, new item tab, does not preserve the images. The image gets unloaded when it
  is added to the view. Also its status is erased.
- Incorrect icon for the login dialog.
- Removing rows from the new item tab fails (sometimes).
- Incorrect normalization; when searching for "Stargate the Ark of Truth" it is normalized
  to "Stargateark of Truth".
- Operations on the tree panel were performed multiple times (performance bug).
- QuaQua look and feel does not work with the Data Crow layout. This look and feel has
  been removed.
- Movie synchronizer does not work.
- Right click does not select the item in the view.

[New]
- Platform change: on database initialization columns lengths are now checked against
  the module definition and changed accordingly. (Text fields only).
- Experience modes: Data Crow now features a beginner and an expert user level. This allows
  new users to start of with a fewer option allowing them to focus on the basics of 
  Data Crow. On startup you will be requested to select your own experience level.
  At any time you can switch to an alternate user mode (no restart required). 

[Changed]
- Rewrote the code for the Tree Panel (TreePanel). It was overly complex and the initial
  build of the tree was too slow. The new tree is about 90% faster which shortens the
  startup time for Data Crow. 
- Improved grouping; it is now possible to group on more then 2 fields (levels), 
  creating a multilevel overview of your items. Any field can now be selected. 
- Maximum length for Description fields (and other long text fields) has been increased
  to hold an (almost) unlimited amount of characters.
- You can define the maximum text length for each field displayed in the quick view.
- Better handling of text in the quick view. Enters are now preserved. 
- Improved the handling of MKV files (Matroska) for the movie file import.
- The music file import had the ability to perform an online search during the import. 
  The other importers, such as the movie file import, did not have this ability. 
  All file importers now allow to use the directory information and are capable of 
  performing an online search.
- File import now uses the art present in the import folder. Using a settings dialog
  you can specify if to import local art and which keywords the art files should contain. 
  (Art means local JPG or PNG files which come with downloaded movies, mps's and software).

  character set. The option is remembered for later runs.
- The migration tool could not be canceled. A cancel button has been placed on the form.
- The cover search for amazon did not pass the artist name; for most music albums no

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The first startup on an existing database will take longer then usual. The script
      format is changed. The conversion is, silently, done on startup. After the
      first startup Data Crow will run as fast as normal.

[New]
- Users can now create plugins. These will be available from the plugins
  menu and from the view popup menu. Plugin should be stored in the 'plugins' folder
  of the Data Crow installation. 
  A plugin must extend the 'net.datacrow.core.plugin.Plugin' class. The package name
  should start with 'plugins' (as the plugins folder is the base package).
  Additional jar files should also be copied to the plugins folder (or in any sub-folder 
  of this folder). These will be loaded automatically. Documentation will be created for 
  this feature.
- Security. Users can be created and assigned specific rights. Among these rights are
  field access (read/write), module access and plugin access.

- Exception when saving a massive amount of music albums or audio CDs
  (CuncurrentModificationException).
- On closing an unmodified image a message is displayed stating the item has changed 
  while in fact it has not. This only occurs with imported images. 
- After an image import there are some items which do not have an image displayed 
  in the insert tab of the card view. After saving the image shows up in the item tab.
- Connection was not correctly closed by the amazon cover search.
  (unknown side-effects as these connections get closed automatically after a timeout).
- Small memory leak for the image retrieval done by the online search.
- Errors in log (non-fatal) 'Error while applying settings to column null for field 
  definition x' when the contact person module is disabled.
- No message displayed when nothing was found during an online search. This only occurs
  when there are already items present in the online search window from previous searches. 
- Strange characters in IMDB movie search for actor names.
  
[Known issues]
- Saving of new users takes a long time. This will be resolved in one of the next 
  versions.

Data Crow 3.1.30 [Release on 12/02/2008] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The product is slowly recovering from the high impact changes of the 3.1 version.
This version again contains crucial fixes. Data Crow is slowly but surely maturing.
I have again chosen to create an in between release (this is the 3.1.30 version instead
of the 3.2 version) as I want you to benefit as soon as possible from these bug fixes.

There are also a few changes and new functionality to be found in this version. 
The File Renaming functionality is the biggest addition and is the first tool which 
manipulates data outside of Data Crow.

NOTE: 1 This version contains a database upgrade. 
      2 Create a backup before you install this version! 
        Use the 'backup & restore' tool from your old version.

[New]
- [1729965] File Renamer. Allows you to rename files (and even move them) of a module 
  based on information entered in Data Crow. This tool can also be used to move files 
  into a different directory structure (convenient for music files). The renaming is 
  based on a 'pattern' which can be created using the GUI. A preview is shown first
  before the actual renaming starts. he help has been updated to include this tool.

[Changed]
- [1886230] The rating system has been changed from a 5-based rating to a 10-based rating.
  All existing ratings will be converted to the new system; each rating is multiplied
  by 2. Online Searches have been updated accordingly. 
- [1885034] The File Import will no longer display a message box when a single file 
  cannot be parsed. Instead it will just log the error and continue with the next file.
- Added ratings to the MobyGames search result(s).
- Table headers are now styled after the selected Look and Feel.

[Fixed]
- Help does not show when the focus is on a (text) field.
- Entered text in the 'Text Dialog' (opened by double clicking on a large text field) 
  is not saved. A NullPointerException is shown in the log.
- Query errors in the log while saving imported Music Albums (no impact or data loss):
  "Attempt to insert null into a non-nullable column: column: ID table: 
  MUSICTRACK in statement [INSERT INTO musictrack (AlbumID) VALUES (?)]"
- Children are incorrectly added to the table insert view by both the Online Search
  and File Import functionality (all to one album).
- Mass update and the online search part of the Music Album Importer did not set the
  image(s).
- Uniqueness check for items was broken.
- Picture disappears when a newly added item is updated. The image was not deleted as it
  reappears after a restart.
- NullPointerException when opening item from the menubar while no item has been selected.
- Creating a new item from within the media module fails.
- Removing / Deleting an item from the media module uses the view of the 'actual module'
  instead of the current, media module, view. This causes another item to be deleted.
- Audio CD is not removed from the tree when deleted. A refresh of the view fixes this.
- Incorrect message being displayed when saving the selected audio CD from the table view
  (save > 'Do you want to save changes' > 'Yes' > Twice the message 'Changes saved').
- [1891575] Existing book won't update and can't close book window
- 99% CPU usage after performing an online search. Occurs only with the MusicBrainz 
  online search and is hard to reproduce. 
- Changes to the font are not applied on the menubar and the toolbar(s). Switching 
  between modules does update the font.

Data Crow 3.1.25 [Release on 29/01/2008] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an early release as the 3.1 version contained a couple of fundamental problems 
which could not be fixed by releasing a patch. This release also contains new 
functionality. A brand new tool, the Drive Manager, and two new online searches have 
been added, Alapage (a french book search) and Barnes & Nobles (an american book search).

I planned to add more features and online searches, but, unfortunately, stabilizing and
maturing the product needed more priority. These will be added to one of the future 
releases.

NOTE: 1 This version contains multiple database upgrades. 
      2 Create a backup before you install this version! Use the 'backup & restore' tool
        from your old version.
      
See the readme.txt file for upgrade paths for versions older then 3.0.

[Fixed]
- [1879348] Online search second isbn hit uses results first isbn hit
- [1878712] Software module is shown twice, Book module not selectable
- [1878652] Cannot close Data Crow
- [1855123] Wrong year when adding CD from MusicBrainz
- [1880118] NullPointer exception on startup
- [1876104] Updating bug
- Incorrect storage of cross table values for music artist and music genre. All
  mappings are saved to the Audio CD crosstables. A conversion is performed after
  installing and starting this version. You will not loose any data by doing this
  upgrade.
- Error while saving a child record (no impact).
- Exception on startup (no impact).
- Data Crow window is too large by default, causing it to go off screen in some
  situation (low resolution of the desktop and, for some reason, on the Mac OS X).
- The software module is duplicated; it is saved both in upper and lower case 
  (software.jar and Software.jar). Added a check for other modules as well.
- Loan panel / form now has the correct layout.
- In the table view edited tracks (child records) are not stored when pressing "save".
- Random hang of the application (changed invokeAndWait to invokeLater).
- Quick Filter toolbar and Filter Dialog show disabled fields.
- When an update causes the item to be put in a new node of the tree, this new node
  is not selected. Same thing when it is moved to another existing node in the tree.
- Audio Track module had lost its genres field. Re-added and removed the duplicated
  artists field.
- Line numbers are missing for error stack traces.
- Filtering on children does not work correctly (example: 'Audio Track Artists contains
  'Abba' would never return all Audio CD's with tracks from 'Abba').
- 'Undo grouping' from the grouping panel clears the grouping AND the view. After 
  performing a search the view is filled correctly. View should not be cleared.
- Double clicking on one of the items in the online search step of the item wizard
  adds the item to the 'new items' tab instead of continuing to the next step.
- Random unhandled exception: "java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException". This is due
  to removing and adding components in an not threadsafe way.
  (http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4241014).
- In the view edited information is not correctly used by the item form (on saving).
  It shows the values correctly however on saving the old values are stored instead of 
  the new values.  
- Error when returning an item; status is not correctly updated in the view. A restart
  fixes this.
- Wrong regions are shown for the selected server for both the music file import and
  the Mass Update dialogs.
- Incorrect label for 'new item' menu item when templates are present.
- Error when updating a template. The template is saved, but the item form cannot be
  closed (NullPointer Exception). 

[New]
- File hash is stored to uniquely identify the file on the system. 
- New tool: Drive Manager. Manages drives on the system and makes sure Data Crow items
  containing file information remain up to date with the file system. (see the help
  for detailed information). Note that the selectable drives are depending on the 
  platform Data Crow is running on; in some cases only the "/" drive will be available.
- Alapage.com book search.
- Barnes & Nobles book search.
- Opening an item from the 'Media' module does not diplay the items pictures and shows
  an incorrect message 'there are unsaved changes' when closing the form.

[Changed]
- Modules now include a version number for upgrading purposes.
- Converted the current file size information (kilo bytes) to bytes.
- Added a sepecial file size field (showing the value in bytes).
- Add a property to modules: isFileBacked. When present, the system will add a filehash,
  filesize and a filename field to the module automatically. The module will also be
  used by the new Drive Manager functionality.

Data Crow 3.1 [Release on 21/01/2008] [testing: high] [target: production]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This latest production version is a major overhaul of the internal system of Data Crow.
These will not be immediately apparent to the average user however it has caused 
noticeable positive side effects: increased startup performance, lower memory usage,
better performing views. 

Note: Java 1.4 and lower versions are no longer supported.

(*) View structures:

          Old view structure                    New view structure
     (complex and poor code re-use)     (clear structure, optimal code re-use)
     
                View                                 View

  * A view uses a view component to actually display its items. In the old
    situation a new view component type meant having to add at least 3 new classes
    to talk to this component. In the new situation only the view component itself
    has to be created, by implementing the IViewComponent interface. The, generic,
    View class can talk to any component implementing the IViewComponent interface.

Data Crow 3.1.0 beta 2 [Release on 13/01/2008] [testing: moderate] [target: BETA]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first beta was compiled against the wrong Java version. It also contained one serious
bug which caused Data Crow to lockup after performing a second search.

[Fixed]
- Data Crow hangs on a second search. (introduced by beta 1)
- Data Crow does not run on Java 1.5. (introduced by beta 1)
- [1869780] 3.1 installation on Vista failed


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Crow 3.1.0 beta 1 [Release on 11/01/2008] [testing: moderate] [target: BETA]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recently there have been complaints of poor performance and lockups. As I am unable to
reproduce these kinds of errors, both on Windows Xp, 98 and Ubuntu 7.10, I urge people
having experienced these errors to help me test this beta release.

This release consist for the most parts of platform changes; new Java features
have been implemented, the internal view structure has undergone major changes and 
the old logging mechanism has been replaced with Log4j. 

Feature requests not yet implemented will be added to one of the next releases.

[Remarks]
  I have had several users asking me why the online search is slower compared to using
  a web browser and search yourself:
  
  Performance of IMDB search (and other online searched) is slower then when you would 
  go to the imdb website and search yourself. There are multiple reasons for this, the 
  most obvious is that Data Crow needs to transform the webpage into something that can
  be saved to the database. Another point is that Data Crow retrieves a larger image,
  a more detailed description, etc, from other locations. This takes more time.
  Other factors play a role as well; internet connection speed, firewall, virus scanner,
  etc. 

[New]

- [1751690] Store update source per record
- Modules are defined in XML instead of being hard coded
- Additional field setting: descriptive y/n. This settings overrules the default 
  way an item is described (such as in the list view).
- Support for Java 1.4. Multiple persons indicated they could not use Data Crow because
  of the missing Java 1.4 support.

  then 2).
- The parameters for data crow have changed:
  to specify a different database: -db:<name>
  to indicate the installation directory (fix for bug): -dir:<directory> (spaces allowed)
- FreeDB support has been canceled. The discid reading is unstable and can no longer be 
  supported. The addition of discogs (new) and musicbrainz should soften the pain.

  pre-selected.
- Integer definitions have changed to long values.
- The image fields in the item form are now easily edited & deleted. It also gained a 
  lot of new functionality (see the new section).
- Improved the online search for updating existing items. The actual link
  from which the item was found (if applicable) is stored and used to re-parse
  the item. 
- Selected field in the quick filter bar is remembered.
- Added 'does not contains' operator for filtering.
- When pressing "edit" to edit a saved filter the corresponding tab is opened.
- A double-click on an image field now either opens the browse dialog (when no
  image has been defined as yet) or the new edit dialog (ImageJ) for existing
  images.
- Refactoring of the online search. The implementation was scattered over 
  several classes and packages. The functionality is now structured to make
  it maintainable and easier to expand.
- The URL field has gained launch button.
- The database layer implementation has changed. To comply with future plans, the
  SQL is created using the prepared statements provide by Java.
- Renamed 'Program Definitions' to 'File Associations' in the settings menu
- Lowered the amount of I/O (disk) operations when dealing with images in views.
- Removed the "save current" button from the settings view.
- When searching for new items online you can now specify which values should be
  retrieved.
- Persons and companies are now "associates" instead of (all) "persons".
- Changed the name of the "odd row color" and "even row color" to "odd color" and
  "even color".
- Card view uses the even and odd color
- The date field has gained a date picker (calendar).
- In the wizard the button "finish & restart" has been renamed to "finish & new" as
  this was confusing for most users in case of the module wizard(s).
- Minor modules (actors and such) are no longer available from the modules menu in
  the menu bar.
- For the online search a new option has been introduced to also search online for
  items like actors, developers, etc. This option is turned off by default as the
  decrease in speed is significant. However when turned on, more detailed information
  is retrieved, such as a description and a photo. Existing items are of course re-used
  (as in the old situation). Turning this off will just create the item (if it does not
  exist yet) having only the name filled in. You can use the mass update or the online 
  update later on on these items.
- Books have gained new fields: storage medium (for e-books) and file size .
- 'Generic Objects' module has its name changed to 'Media'
- Improved Amazon search
- Sub-items like categories and authors are now only added to the database if the item
  to which these belong is saved. This prevents polution of the database after doing 
  an online search.
- Reports have been polished (a little). 
- It is now possible to point a report to a stylesheet from the properties file. 
  This stylesheet is copied to the directory of the generated report. For now this is
  used for the HTML reports. The stylesheets themselves can be found in 
  "/report/_stylesheets".  
- The logo has been updated / altered as well as the program icons.
